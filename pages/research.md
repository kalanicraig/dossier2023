My research takes three primary forms:

- digital-tool and historical-method design with software and learning-science researchers
- analytical digital-history projects in collaboration with other historians using these digital tools and methods
- digital public engagement projects in collaboration with academic and non-academic communities using these tools and methods

Each of my digital-history projects integrates digital-history tool design and methods development in different measure and with various collaborators that extend the impact of my work to other subfields within history as well as beyond the field of history.
