My research output takes four primary forms, from which I draw to articulate the individual elements of six major research projects:

1. digital-tool and historical-method design with a variety of partners.
	- [Net.Create](/items/01_netcreate.html)
	- the digital-exhibit toolkit that anchors [Community Archive Digital Projects](/items/02_communityarchive.html)
	- other digital-tool development under the auspices of [Design-Based History Research](/statement#research-digital-history-tool-and-methods-design)
1. analytical digital-history projects in collaboration with other historians using my digital tools and methods.
	- [MMATCH](/items/03_MMATCH.html)
	- Text-based publications rooted in digital-tool design or digital public history (e.g. [Sutton & Craig, DHQ 2022](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/3/000640/000640.html))
1. digital public engagement projects in collaboration with academic and non-academic communities using digital tools and methods.
	- [History Harvests](https://historyharvest.indiana.edu) like [Remembering Freedom](https://longtownhistory.github.io), some of which are built on the  [Community Archive Toolkit](/items/02_communityarchive.html)
	- [Global Middle Ages Pilgrimage](/items/06_GlobalMedieval.html)
1. digital-humanities capacity-building and scholarly-communications research that explores how to better incorporate digital tools and methods into the academy.

## Major Research Projects

Each of the digital-history forms above, represented to varying measures in the six projects below, integrates digital-history tool design and methods development with various collaborators that extend the impact of my work to other subfields within history as well as beyond the field of history. The project overviews below:

1. start with a project goal and note any external funding
1. outline the research products that constitute (or accompany, in the case of documentation and installation guides) the main digital-history tool
1. note peer-reviewed publications and conference proceedings as well as general conference presentations and other activities
