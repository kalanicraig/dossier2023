My research takes four primary forms:

1. digital-tool and historical-method design with a variety of partners
1. analytical digital-history projects in collaboration with other historians using digital tools and methods
1. digital public engagement projects in collaboration with academic and non-academic communities using digital tools and methods
1. digital-humanities capacity-building and scholarly-communications research that explores how to better incorporate digital tools and methods into the academy

Each of my digital-history projects integrates digital-history tool design and methods development in different measure and with various collaborators that extend the impact of my work to other subfields within history as well as beyond the field of history.
