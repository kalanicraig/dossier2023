When historians use tools designed by people in other disciplines, their disciplinary needs shape our analysis. The methods we use to integrate those tools into our historical analysis--from integrating the simplest of search queries, to the use of complex digital tools for in-depth analysis--also have implications for the work of a historian. One of the contributions Design-Based History Research makes to the practice of history is to shape the future of our research as a field through the concurrent and intertwined development of historical theory, digital-history tools, and historical methods.
