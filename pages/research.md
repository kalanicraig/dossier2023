My research takes four primary forms:

1. digital-tool and historical-method design with a variety of partners
1. analytical digital-history projects in collaboration with other historians using digital tools and methods
1. digital public engagement projects in collaboration with academic and non-academic communities using digital tools and methods
1. digital-humanities capacity-building and scholarly-communications research that explores how to better incorporate digital tools and methods into the academy

Each of my digital-history projects integrates digital-history tool design and methods development in different measure and with various collaborators that extend the impact of my work to other subfields within history as well as beyond the field of history.

## Major Research Projects

Each of these digital-history research overviews
1. starts with a project goal and notes any external funding
1. outlines the research products that constitute (or accompany, in the case of documentation and installation guides) the main digital-history tool
1. notes peer-reviewed publications and conference proceedings as well as general conference presentations
