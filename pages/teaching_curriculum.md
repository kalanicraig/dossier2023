## Overview

Curriculum development at the campus level has occupied a portion of my service duties, at both the undergraduate and graduate level. Each of these curriculum-development efforts has centered on the ways in which humanities learning can be augmented by digital methods at the same time that we encourage students to question the assumptions and algorithms built into those digital methods.

At the graduate level, I served on IU Bloomington's Digital Arts and Humanities PhD Certificate creation committee in 2014. On my appointment as IDAHâ€™s co-director in August of 2017, I developed the curricular and administrative infrastructure necessary to launch the program based on that 2014 committee's design, including the recruiting and convening of a curriculum committee to oversee the development, submission and teaching of new courses to meet the program requirements, and advising prospective students. Since Spring of 2018, we've done individual advising each semester for 40 individual students, admitted 24 to the program overall, and awarded 10 minors and certificates.

At the undergraduate level, I've been involved in the development of several undergraduate programs that center technical and scientific practice in the critical lens of humanities interpretation. ASURE, the program has been on offer for College direct admits since Fall of 2018 and includes a fall-semester introductory course, which I chaired a subcommittee to develop, and a spring-semester hands-on research course, for which I developed and taught A200 Digital Public History. These curricular-development efforts also include a committee seat on the College's Undergrad Computing Task Force and its subsequent Committee on Undergraduate Computing in the College, which resulted in a Spring 2020 report that lays out concrete curricular programming, in several tracks, to prepare students for disciplinary-specific use of technology in service of their chosen humanities majors.
