In 2020, IDAH underwent an 3-year external review, which we took as an opportunity to present our work to date and our 3-year strategic plan as public scholarship. Both the report we prepared for external reviewers and the strategic plan, which was presented to external reviewers and then revised, are available on the IDAH web site.

The public release of these documents has led to 3 consults with the directors of other digital-humanities centers (all peer institutions of IU with one multi-day consult and two 2-hour consults) about how to model capacity-building practices for their institutions.

IDAH's other annual reports have been private documents, so they are in the protected service section of IU's eDossier rather than counted in the Digital-Humanities Capacity-Building Research.
