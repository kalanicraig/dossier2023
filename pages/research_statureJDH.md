The Journal of Digital History launched in 2021 thanks to a partnership between De Gruyter Publishing and the University of Luxembourg's Centre for Contemporary and Digital History. This ground-breaking authoring-and-publishing platform is centered around "digital hermeneutics", or an interactive platform lets digital historians meld traditional historical narratives with interactive argumentation, visualization, analysis and data.

Its innovative presentation of these layers offers readers the ability to explore the various contributions each stage of a scholarly project makes to the final historical argument.

As a first-of-its-kind journal, the editors published an article that presents the journal's theoretical and practical goals, all of which suited the Net.Create Design-Based History Research article exceptionally well:
