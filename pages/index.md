title: Design-based History Research for Digital History

Like all historians, I'm interested in the stories people tell that help document change and continuity over time. Like most *digital* historians, I explore these stories using a variety of digital tools and new methods. In some cases, I'm interested in big-data approaches  to analysis; digital tools support networks, maps and computational text analysis and help historians find patterns, fill gaps, and look for new questions in historical documents. I also work with interactive modes of presentation; these digital tools afford historians new ways to present historical scholarship and to engage with new publics.

***When digital historians make use of tools and methods developed by other disciplines for these analytical and presentational projects, we inherit the priorities and norms of those disciplines. My goal is to prioritize history's disciplinary norms as the foundation for the design of digital-history tools and methods.*** My research trajectory as a digital historian, then, is focused on the concurrent and intertwined development of historical theory, digital-history tools, and historical methods. That research takes three primary forms:

- digital-tool and historical-method design with software and learning-science researchers
- analytical digital-history projects in collaboration with other historians using these digital tools and methods
- digital public engagement projects in collaboration with academic and non-academic communities using these tools and methods

This trajectory was shaped by a decade of experimentation with the boundaries of traditional historical research, teaching and service. As a consequence, many of my projects combine one or more of my digital-history practices, and all of my projects are shaped around collaborations that support digital-history endeavors at a variety of scales.

My research has been supported by $2.25 million in grant funding (2 NSF and 2 private-foundation grants) and includes digital-history tool design (Net.Create), digital public history endeavors (History Harvests and community archives), and argument-driven digital-history research (Sutton & Craig, DHQ 2022; Craig & Diaz, AHR, forthcoming). Each of my digital-history projects integrates digital-history tool design and methods development in different measure and with various collaborators that extend the impact of my work to other subfields within history as well as beyond the field of history.

<!-- ## NOTES TO ME:

# In this dossier

- [Personal statement](/casestudy): An narrative of my research, teaching, and service trajectories
- [Research](/research): A detailed overview of my research projects
- [Teaching](/teaching): An exploration of digital-history methods in the classroom
- [Service](/service): Contributions to the development of disciplinary expertise in digital humanities and digital history, and contributions to digital-history pedagogy programs



1. WHY IDAH? IDAH offers a wide view of digital-arts-and-humanities needs and a more clear understanding of where history needs and non-history disciplinary humanities needs overlap and don't, so I can prioritize. It also means there's a platform for making the tool-building work visible outside of history, both on IU's campus and beyond. DH is a collaborative discipline, DBHR is built around that collaboration, as are Net.Create and the Community-Archive project.
