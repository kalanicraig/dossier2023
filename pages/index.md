## Design-Based History Research in the production and communication of historical knowledge

This dossier supports my bid for tenure as Associate Professor of History on the basis of research. My research agenda centers on *Design-Based History Research*, a digital-history tool design process that documents change and continuity over time in the context of a digital-history tool design process. Like argument-driven digital history, DBHR begins with a question about change and continuity over time documented with primary sources and contextualized with historical scholarship. That question drives a cycle of theoretically-motivated tool design and building which is then interspersed with small-scale testing intended to provide proof-of-concept theoretical models for disciplinary innovation usable by other researchers.

My goal as a designer of new digital history research tools and methods has been supported by XXXX in grants (2 NSF, 2 private foundation) across a variety of in-progress projects rooted in [Design-Based History Research](/casestudy), each one of which integrates digital-history tool design and methods development in different measure and with various collaborators that extend the impact of my work both to subfields within history and beyond the field of history. This digital-history agenda opens up new spaces in the discipline that are designed for and by a historian, so that we can explore change and continuity over time with digital tools, independently or in collaborative partnerships with other scholars and with the communities whose lives and histories are at stake in our work as historians. <!--TO DO: add specific details from the highlights section in this paragraph -->

<!--
Thesis: My work as a digital historian since 2015 has led me to a research trajectory focused on the integration of new digital methods and collaborative practices in the production of historical scholarship. In the past 2 years in particular, I have reconceptualized that practice as "Design Based History Research".


## NOTES TO ME:

1. WHY IDAH? IDAH offers a wide view of digital-arts-and-humanities needs and a more clear understanding of where history needs and non-history disciplinary humanities needs overlap and don't, so I can prioritize. It also means there's a platform for making the tool-building work visible outside of history, both on IU's campus and beyond. DH is a collaborative discipline, DBHR is built around that collaboration, as are Net.Create and the Community-Archive project.
