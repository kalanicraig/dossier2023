## Design-Based History Research in the production and communication of historical knowledge

My work as a digital historian since 2015 has led me to a research trajectory focused on the integration of new digital methods and collaborative practices in the production of historical scholarship. In the past 2 years in particular, I have reconceptualized that practice as "[Design-Based History Research](/research)" (DBHR), which is supported by a forthcoming article in the Journal of Digital History. My DBHR research to date is anchored in a network analysis tool called [Net.Create]() (with $2.25 million in funding to date), as a digital-methods specialist on teams incorporating digital analysis into humanities projects (articulated as [Mixed-Method Approaches to Collaborative History](), in a forthcoming article), and in a practice centered on [community archiving projects]() (which includes the digital-exhibit platform this dossier is built on).


<!-- ## NOTES TO ME:

1. WHY IDAH? IDAH offers a wide view of digital-arts-and-humanities needs and a more clear understanding of where history needs and non-history disciplinary humanities needs overlap and don't, so I can prioritize. It also means there's a platform for making the tool-building work visible outside of history, both on IU's campus and beyond. DH is a collaborative discipline, DBHR is built around that collaboration, as are Net.Create and the Community-Archive project.
