## Net.Create

Abstract

### DBHR stages

#### Past

#### Current

#### Future

- Integrated data provenance (which researcher added this?). We have it but it's in logs, and we'd like to make that more accessible to the team. Provenance supports better researcher positionality (MMATCH as part of the Net.Create DBHR process)
- Integrated commenting. This lets the team have a staged historiographic debate in an asynch collaboration environment without directly changing the node/edge data
- Private comments. This lets each member of the team take separate notes as part of their own historian's work.
